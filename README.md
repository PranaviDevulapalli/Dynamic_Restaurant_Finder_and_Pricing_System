# Dynamic_Restaurant_Finder_and_Pricing_System
This web app uses the Google Maps API to let users explore nearby restaurants dynamically. It shows restaurants around a selected location, with zoom capabilities. If a restaurant is selected, it adjusts menu pricing based on temperature, rain probability, and busyness. If not, it displays nearby restaurants within a 5 km radius.
